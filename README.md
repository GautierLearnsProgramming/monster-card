A simple React project, created with create react-app and using Ant Design.

Code is 100% home-made (apart from create-react-app boilerplate), but design is mostly copied from a Udemy course exercise : https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-native-mobile-development-zero-to-mastery-with-hooks/
